  <!-- Exercise instructions:

     1. Create a stepper to guide user through a sequence of steps, use any real reference to complete this.
     2. Must contain at least 4 diferent steps, a back button on each of the steps except for the first one.
     3. The info must be consistent and really explain the user what he is doing on every step.
     NOTE: Use material design guidelines for this stepper, I will be looking for symmetry and exact measurements (but
     you could use your criteria on how many pixels you are using on every component).
