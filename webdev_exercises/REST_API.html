  <!-- Instructions:
     1. Create a form which will contain multiple inputs, those inputs will be disabled until the user has selected
     the first input. (those have to be any non simple text input, may be dropdowns, checkboxes, multipleselects, etc...)
     2. The label info must focus the input when user clicks on it.
     3. At least 3 of the inputs must have info generated from a REST-api with $.ajax in a javascript promise.
     IMPORTANT: need to implement then and catch callbacks and change something in the DOM.

        please (optional) search for another better fake api https://reqres.in/
     4. (Optional) user may add info to those inputs and data would be saved (POST).
     5. Add a link to a html page where users can learn about ajax and promises (make it easy for the user)
